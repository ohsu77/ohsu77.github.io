For the right pointer, it will access the next index if the product of the current window satisfies the condition, which is less than K. In other words, the left pointer will be moved if it is larger than K to shrink and find the appropriate window.  The Most important thing in this logic is to count the valid number of subarrays using right - left + 1 so that we don’t have to go over the subarray to find a valid combination within the window again.Let’s think simple! If the window is valid, its subarrays are already verified to meet the condition.  Why +1 ?  Since we extends the right pointer, we should also calculate the new right pointer num itself!"

Thus, focusing on the overlapping part is the key to solving this problem. The method checks between the ending part of the existing interval and the starting part of the incoming part.There is another way to sort the input using lambda instead of sorted().sorted_intervals = intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])This allows us to choose sorting intervals based on the starting position.

[2,1] with score (2 + 1) * 2 = 6. 💡 Note that subarrays such as [1,4] and [4,3,5] are not considered because their scores are 10 and 36 respectively, while we need scores strictly less than 10.  💻 CodeApproach :  Sliding Window ✅          left &amp; right        Calculation for this problem is: (sum of elements) $*$ (length of the elements) $&lt; k$  A subarray is a contiguous sequence  Return: How many possibilities?1.

Thus, left and right pointers are moving as needed. In this solution, it calculates for the current index first and then decides by keeping with counting or deducting the most left element.💡 The important thing to be considered is the time complex. It can be considered as $O(n^2)$, but $O(n)$ in my solution. Let’s think about using amortized analysis. The outer for loop runs in $n$ times, and the inner while loop runs at most $n$ times in a worst case. Thus, the inner loop only visits each element once as necessary. In other words, the inner loop never goes up more than $n$ times.Additional Practice713. Subarray Product Less Than K (medium)"

The gist of it is figuring out how the components of preorder and inorder represent when it is converted to a tree.The inefficiency of this method is accessing the current parent point of the inorder since it uses index() function. This searches index traversing an array from index 0, which means $O(n)$.

First, it counts with a hash map so that we know each element appeared how many times.   Second, a priority queue can be used by importing heapq.

Unique strings.  Matching strings in s cannot be overlapped.1.

Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.💻 Code1. Brute Force (does not pass all cases)  TC : O(n)  SC: O(n) - stackclass Solution:    def rob(self, nums: List[int]) -&gt; int:        n = len(nums)           res = 0        odd_house = []        even_house = [nums[0]]        for i in range(1, n):            if i % 2 == 1:\t# odd houses                odd_house.append(nums[i])            else:                even_house.append(nums[i])                    res = max(sum(odd_house), sum(even_house))          return res My initial approach to the problem is checking houses to see whether they are odd or even.However, this method can’t handle edge cases. For example, there is a possibility that the sum of indices 0 and 3 can make a maximum amount.2. Dynamic Programming  TC : O(n)  SC: O(n) - DPclass Solution:    def rob(self, nums: List[int]) -&gt; int:        n = len(nums)        if n == 1:            return nums[0]        dp = [0] * n        dp[0] = nums[0]        dp[1] = max(nums[0], nums[1])        for i in range(2, n):            dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2] + nums[i])        return dp[-1]Using Dynamic Programming cut the edges where I had a problem. This compares with the current(i - 2) + current(i) and current(i - 1), and the current the maximum value is stored at the current position in dp.By changing the current value, we can see more than the odd &amp; even range that I did earlier.However, since this method stores n length values to dp, the space complexity is O(n).3. Optimal Solution  Inplace shifting  TC : O(n)  SC: O(1)class Solution:    def rob(self, nums: List[int]) -&gt; int:        # [...,  prev, max, curr, ...]        prev_house = 0        max_house = 0                if len(nums) == 1:            return nums[0]        for curr in nums:            temp = max(max_house, prev_house + curr)            prev_house = max_house  # we know, num increment by 1, as well as prev_house            max_house = temp    # change current house as max_house        return max_houseThis is a more efficient way of dealing with the space complexity. There are no other storing variables, such as a stack. It just calculates the current maximum value while it is iterating over all elements.The Key for this method is resetting prev and max points.Additional materials      House Robber II  (The new circumstance is houses are in circle formation)  💡2 cases to be considered  "
