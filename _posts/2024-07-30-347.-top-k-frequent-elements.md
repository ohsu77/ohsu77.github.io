## **Example**
---
> **Input:** nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2<br>
> **Output:** [1,2]<br>

## **ðŸ’» Code**
#### **Approach** : Count each number using hash, then prioritize for `k` number of elements.

### **1. Brute force** 
---
- Hash Map & Priority Queue
- **TC** : `O(n log n)`
    - `n` : hash map
    - `log m` : heap
- **SC**: `O(n)`

```python
class Solution:
    def topKFrequent(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        freq = {}

        for num in nums:
            if num not in freq:
                freq[num] = 1
            else:
                freq[num] += 1

        heap = []
        for num, count in freq.items():
            heapq.heappush(heap, (count, num))  # store count first! (minHeap)
            if len(heap) > k:
                heapq.heappop(heap)
        
        res = [num for count, num in heap]

        return res
```
This method is operated in 2 steps. <br>
1. First, it counts with a **hash map** so that we know each element appeared how many times. <br>
2. Second, a priority queue can be used by importing `heapq`. Since the minheap is a default implementation in Python, storing count first allows it to pop least frequent elements first when `heapq` is full; this only stores `k` number of most frequent elements.

### **2. Optimised Solution** 
---
- Hash Map & Bucket Sort
- **TC** : `O(n)`
- **SC**: `O(n)`

```python
class Solution:
    def topKFrequent(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        res = []
        freq = {}
        # [[], [], [], [], [], []]
        buckets = [[] for _ in range(len(nums))]
        
        for num in nums:
            if num not in freq:
                freq[num] = 1
            else:
                freq[num] += 1

        for num, cnt in freq.items():
            # bucket starts from index 0, so cnt - 1
            buckets[cnt - 1].append(num)
        
        # iterate the bucket from the end (most frequent)
        for i in range(len(buckets) - 1, -1, -1):
            if buckets[i]:
                for j in bucekts[i]:
                    res.append(j)
                    if len(res) == k:
                        return res
```
The feature of the Bucket Sort is to store multiple elements at a single index by creating subarrays.<br>

We can simply iterate the bucket from the back until we have `k` number of elements.

> #### Additional Material
> Using `extend(arr)` helps to have more brief code.
> 
```python
# Learning how to use extend() function
# it stores all elements inside the bracket (no bracket included)
    for i in range(len(buckets) - 1, -1, -1):
        if buckets[i]:
            res.extend(buckets[i])
            if len(res) >= k:   # extend could store more than k
                return res[:k]
```
> `extend(arr)` basically stores all elements in a single bucekt.
