> **Input:** head = [1,2,3,4,5,6] <br> 
**Output:** [1,6,2,5,3,4] <br> 
```plaintext
   1   ->  2   ->  3   ->  4   ->  5   ->  6    ->  null
=> 1   ->  6   ->  2   ->  5   ->  3   ->  4    ->  null
```

## **üìù Solution**
#### **Approach**
To solve the problem [143. Reorder List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-list/description/), we need to identify a pattern that simplifies the solution. <br>

In essence, we need to reorder the list by alternately placing the first and last elements until we reach the middle. <br>
Strategy:
1. **Find the middle and split the LL** <br>
- To reorder the list, we first need to find the middle to divide it into two separate parts. The challenge here is finding the middle node efficiently in a singly linked list. 
A brute-force approach would involve iterating through all nodes to count them, then traversing again from the head to reach the middle, but this is inefficient.<br>
Using the [fast & slow pointer algorithm](https://emre.me/coding-patterns/fast-slow-pointers/#:~:text=Fast%20%26%20Slow%20Pointers%20Solution,-class%20ListNode%3A%20def&text=slow%20return%20None-,Time%20Complexity%3A%20O(N)%20where%20N%20is%20the%20number,algorithm%20runs%20in%20constant%20space.), allows us to locate the middle in a single pass.<br>
> This approach not only finds the middle efficiently but is also commonly used to detect cycles in a linked list. (a.k.a üê∞ & üê¢) <br>

    ```python
    # set pointers at the start line
    fast = slow = head
    # edge case: odd or even length?
    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
    ```
    We need to check if the linked list length is odd or even. This is why we use `fast` and `fast.next` in the while condition.

2. **Reverse the rear LL**
- By creating `null` node at the beggining, we can reverse the direction.
    ```plaintext
        null          4   ->  5   ->  6   ->  null
        null    <-    4       5   ->  6   ->  null
        null    <-    4   <-  5       6   ->  null
        null    <-    4   <-  5   <-  6       null
    ```
    To implement this logic, we use three pointers:<br>
    - `prev`: Points to the previous node, starting from `null`.
    - `curr`: Points to the current node that we want to redirect.
    - `temp`: pointing  he next node of `curr` to proceed with the next redirecting
    ```python
    prev = None
    curr = slow # `slow` is the middle from step 1
    while curr:
        temp = curr.next
        curr.next = prev
        prev = curr
        curr = temp
    ```
3. **Merge LLs**
- At the beginning of this stage, we have two linked lists., so we need to merge them into a single LL. <br>

    ```plaintext
    1   ->  2   ->  3   ->  null
    6   ->  5   ->  4   ->  null

    =>

    1   ->  6   ->  2   ->  5   ->  3   ->  4    ->  null
    ```
    ```python
    first = head
    second = prev   #prev stopped at the last element from step 2
    while second.next:
        first.next, first = second, first.next
        second.next, second = first, second.next
    ```

## **üíª Code**

```python
class Solution:
    def reorderList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> None:
        # set pointers at the start line
        fast = slow = head
        # edge case: odd or even length?
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next

        prev = None
        curr = slow # slow is the middle from step 1
        while curr:
            temp = curr.next
            curr.next = prev
            prev = curr
            curr = temp

        first = head
        second = prev   #`prev` stopped at the last element from step 2
        while second.next:
            first.next, first = second, first.next
            second.next, second = first, second.next
```
